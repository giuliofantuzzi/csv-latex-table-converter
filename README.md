# Csv - LaTex tabular converter
This repository contains a python script that allows the user to convert a simple csv file into a latex tabular
## Instructions for the user
1) Open your terminal from the location of this python script
2) Run the python script
  ```bash
  >> python3 tableconverter.py
  ```
3) When required, insert the filepath of the file to convert
  ```bash
  >> Insert the name of the csv file to convert:
     path/to/file/file.csv
  ```
4) If conversion was successfully, then your `file.csv` will be converted into a new `file.tex` (saved at the same filepath!)
